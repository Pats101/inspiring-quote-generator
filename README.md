#Reason for Project
The Inspiring Quote Generator is a web page that utilizes an API which spits out quotes along with the author that said it for motivation. I chose this little project based on what I am currently facing.
We all are just people on earth trying to make meaning of our lives at the same time trying to be there for our loved ones. More times than often, one would feel lost, confused, scared, 
discouraged, defeated and they wonder when will they get a break. One can not eat words but some how when words are formed and structured into good sentences they can bring a sense of comfort within.
